This is a web-page showing the projects I have worked upon when it comes to Data Analysis.

# [Project 1: Analysis of Kaggle dataset: Video_Games_Sales](https://jovian.ai/abhi-gangalwar/video-games-sales-data)
* Analyzed the dataset using various Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, numpy etc.
* Gained good knowledge of using pandas to clean data and analyze the dataframe.
* Performed visualization using seaborn and matplotlib to draw patterns out of data.
* Used scatter plot to analyse the relationship between sales in North America and Global sales.
* Please, go through the jupyter notebook hyperlinked with project title to see the depth of knowledge I gained from this project.
